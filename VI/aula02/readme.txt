Go through projects simple.xml to simple4.xml while reading the notes made available in the course web page.

Project simple5.xml requires you to write shaders.

Open simple5.xml, and lookup the library file name. Also take note of the shader name mentioned in the pipeline. Open the library file to check the file name of the shaders. In the material check the parameters. You'll require these parameters to write the shader.

The vertex shader is already implemented, but the fragment shader is empty. Your job is to fill it :-)
