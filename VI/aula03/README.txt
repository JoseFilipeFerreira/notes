This folder contains the projects that were mentioned in the 3rd lecture.

- toonPerVertex - the toon effect applied per vertex.
- toonMixed and toonMixed2 are two intermediate steps before the per pixel implementattion.

The assignment for lecture 3 is to write the shaders for the toon effect per pixel.

A project is already built (toonPerPixel.xml). Do explore it and its accompanying material library file (toonBlocks.mlib)

In the shaders folder you can find two shaders, toonV and toonP, that have are already set but the main function is empty. Fill in this shaders to achieve per pixel toon effect.
